				<header>Nano Hacker Squad</header>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					I helped setup a small very young community of coders, known as the nano hacker squad. It was an exploration on teaching tech for kids but also about collaborative learning and making. The goal was to introduce them to the hackathon culture. This is by far my favorite project of 2014. I was the organizer and lead mentor coming up with coding activities for the kids. We had few other dedicated mentors helping out: Benno, Ricky, Matt and few others.

					One of our young participants was Kiera who developed a couple of ios apps and received an <a href="http://www.ny1.com/nyc/queens/news/2015/07/14/12-year-old-from-the-rockaways-take-tech-world-by-storm.html">Apple scholarship</a>. We did not teach ios. Kiera learnt ios by herself! I used <a href="https://vimeo.com/123988549">my skills</a> on After Effects to help with her video submission.

				<p>
					It's a lovely small engaged talented community still going strong in 2015.

				<header>Green Screening with WebRTC</header>
				<p>
					<a href="http://greenscreen.surge.sh/">http://greenscreen.surge.sh/</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is an exploration of web standards for HTML5 &lt;video&gt;, &lt;canvas&gt; and webrtc that enables real-time video processing, in particular on how to accomplish green screening effects (for free!)
				</p>
				<p>
					It was presented at the <a href="http://developers.nytimes.com/events/71515/">New York Times Open Science Fair 3.0</a> in July, 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					My original motivation was to hack existing online cool effects based on HTML5 &lt;video&gt; by hijacking the &lt;video&gt; tag and changing the video source to the web camera using webrtc's Media Capture API.					
				</p>
				<p>
					Then when Seriously.js was out with the green screening, I couldn't resist trying it out with the hack.
				</p>
				<p>
					I presented it at the Hack n Tell meetup, then I was approached to present it at the NYT Open Source Science Fair.					
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a lot of fun to present to technologists. It's like magic.

				<header>Typographics with SVG Fonts</header>
				<p>
					URL: <a href="http://pedroha.github.io/typographics/html5/ATCG.html">ATCG</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Instructions: Press n/N, i/I, r/R to change Noise, Intensity, Richness
				</p>
				<p>
					This is an interactive HTML5 animation of breaking letters into noisy shapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Originally, I twiddled with some Processing code for some other prototype based on: <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/P_3_2_1_01">http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/P_3_2_1_01</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					To get my desired effect of breaking into noisy shapes using Processing.
					<a href="https://github.com/pedroha/typographics/tree/master/FontLineDots">FontLineDots</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					I wanted to reproduce the same interactive breaking effect using HTML5 but there's no equivalent font processing library on the Javascript side. However, I worked extensively with parsing SVG fonts using JS in some previous exploration. And I explored how to break the SVG into multiple lines with the PolyLineSegmentorSvgCanvasExecutor.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm very pleased with the result since it can be used with most SVG graphics (not just letters) but I'm quite devoted to typographic effects.

				<header>Canvas Trails</header>

				</p>
				<p>
					This was an interactive exploration of animated strokes, whereas the user gets to control the speed and direction of the strokes to create unique experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was conceived during an amazing (and equally overwhelming!) ITP Summer Camp, 2013.

				<header>Without Title by Lia</header>
				<p>
					URL: <a href="http://code.html5genart.com/html5/generative-art/without-title/without-title.html">Without Title by Lia</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a Javascript port of Lia’s <a href="http://www.liaworks.com/theprojects/withouttitle/">Without Title</a>. The original can be seen in her <a href="http://liaworks.com/projects/withouttitle/">Java applet</a>. You should check some of Lia’s really <a href="http://www.liaworks.com/category/theprojects/">amazing projects.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Although this is subjective, the visual quality didn’t equal to the original. It’s my impression that the smooth() function is not working as expected.
				</p>
				<p>
					The drawing performance in the Javascript version is notorious. It feels very responsive. Personally, I find the slower Java/Processing version more pleasant and relaxing. I don’t like to slow things down but it may improve the experience in this case.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can click/move the mouse to interact with the drawing and press any key to pause.

				<header>Rose Fabric</header>
				<p>
					URL: <a href="http://code.html5genart.com/blog/2011/12/11/rose-fabric/">Rose Fabric</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a modification of the first example in chapter four of <a href="http://www.glassner.com/andrew/writing/books/processing.htm">Processing for Visual Artists</a> by Andrew Glassner which consists of an algorithm to simulate the texture of a fabric. I used a vivid pink color and changed the algorithm to be able to visualize the thread creation process one thread at a time.

				<p>
					This is a Javascript port of <a href="http://wealoneonearth.blogspot.com/2011/10/animated-quasicrystals.html">QUASI1.java</a> by Michael Rule. I was playing with different values for K and switching between log-polar and cartesian coordinates. I settled down on K=3 and log-polar as the example for this post. I also cycled colors between blue and green.
